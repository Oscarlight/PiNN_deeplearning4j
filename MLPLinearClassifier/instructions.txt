The main purpose of this screencast was to demonstrate 
the writing of the java code needed to build a 
Multi Layer Perceptron for Linear classification.

Along the way I used a few shell commands that may 
be of interest so they are included here for the sake 
of completeness. 

cut -c1 linear_data_train.csv
cut -c1 linear_data_train.csv | sort |uniq -d
gnuplot gnuplot.sh

gnuplot may not be installed on your system. 
It is free software and is easy to install.

see http://www.gnuplot.info/

I used it in this tutorial to quickly demonstrate the 
structure of the data, it's use is not required. 

If you use the examples from our github collection of examples 
you will find this code with a graphical plot in the java code.
